# Public presence

I do believe that you can build your own successful personal brand on a social media. There's a list of my personal experiments that are helping me build my personal brand: 

I'm building my personal brand on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/AnettRolikova).

I have [Medium account](https://medium.com/@AnettRolikova) where I share blogs regarding to my contributioins to Ethereum projects. 

I started my mind garden on [Tumbr](https://anettrolikova.tumblr.com/), it is like a public place where I share my notes, I share links to articles I read, sometimes I use it to vent my thoughts and clean my mind by writing about my day... It may look messy sometimes but I havenâ€™t found a better platform where I can share my thoughts,yet.

I created Ethereum Community YouTube channel where I did interview with Udi, this is a side project, I would like to film more interviews with people from the Ethereum Ecosystem to give more perspectives out to the public about Ethereum, find ways how to improve, simplify Ethereum, get to know more about people in Ethereum... (unfinished as it is in experimental state)

### Personal self-learnings
I'm into topics like Mental Health, Mindfulness, Health, Self-Learning, Psychology and Sport. I would like to create a short sum-ups from articles that I read, maybe like a collection of the best from my blog. I want to learn more and be consistent and improve myself in writing and read more. I would love to create my own newsletter or have personal blog, most likely I will use this domain for the future plans. For now I'm keeping my blogs on Medium (Ethereum and work related) and Tumblr (personal).
