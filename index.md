# ⟠ My Ethereum Story
I may be seen as someone who just appeared on Crypto Twitter with cute face and got hundreds of followers on Twitter. 
Here’s the story of how I fell into Ethereum rabbit hole in bullet points: 

- April 2018 I visited [Progressbar](https://www.progressbar.sk/) - blockchain focused cowork space for the first time
- September 2018 I started to help out in Progressbar with events
- November 2018 crew from Progressbar went on Devcon4 in Prague, I visited Prague as tourist and got invited on a couple of evening events during Devcon4 - Funfair and Chainlink Event, Rockaway blockchain party, Binance event, Event/ Party in Zizkov Tower. I had no idea what blockchain neither Ethereum is. I meet [Brenda Loya](https://www.linkedin.com/in/brendaloya/) at Funfair event, who gave me valuable advice about not being afraid of being the only girl around guys in tech which for me was eye-opening moment.
- I tried to read about Blockchain and Ethereum on medium.com but I didn’t understood it
- January 2019 volunteer at AraCon - Aragon Conference. I saw the community and felt in love, wanted to be apart of it. Meet Lenka from MakerDAO - she told me about MakerDAO micro grants initiative. And bunch of other sweethearts that I'm in touch until today. I started to use Twitter. Attended GoerliCon where Afri released Goerli Testnet - I had no idea what’s going on, I didn’t understood any of what Afri is doing but I loved the energy in the room, and took bunch of pics that are blurry but everyone was taking pics so I did too :D
- March 2019 organised the [first MakerDAO self-organised meetup](https://blog.makerdao.com/makerdao-global-meetups-and-micro-grants-initiative/) and got micro grant from MakerDAO for it
- April 2019 volunteered on my first ETHGlobal event - ETH Cape Town hackathon where I started to look for my first community gig in Ethereum.
- May 2019 got my first job in Ethereum, I was working with team on Ethereum Governance related project. This was fail but [Griff](https://twitter.com/thegrifft) introduced me to [Jamie](https://twitter.com/jemenger)
- June 2019 [Jamie](https://twitter.com/jemenger) offered me to help him out with [Ethereum Magicians](https://ethereum-magicians.org/). I started to help out with Operations and Events. Jamie became my mentor. This was my most valuable connection in Ethereum that I got.

The story continues in Proof of Work as I started working in the ecosystem full time on a various projects.

# Online presence and experiments
I do believe that you can build your own successful personal brand on a social media. Here are my personal experiments:

I'm building my personal [Twitter](https://twitter.com/AnettRolikova).

I have [Medium account](https://medium.com/@AnettRolikova) where I share blogs regarding to my contributioins to Ethereum projects. I recently started publishing on [Mirror](https://anett.mirror.xyz/) which is decentralised publishing platform but you can find my blogs on [Hackernoon](https://hackernoon.com/u/planett) too.

I'm hoping to start writing more and publishing my ideas on [Substack](https://anett.substack.com/), but no promises on that. I publish there on very irregular basis. 

I started my mind garden on [Tumbr](https://anettrolikova.tumblr.com/), it is like a public [Mind Garden](https://nesslabs.com/mind-garden) where I share my notes,links to articles I read, sometimes I use it to vent my thoughts and clean my mind by writing about my day... It may look messy sometimes but I haven’t found a better platform where I can share my thoughts,yet.

I created Ethereum Community YouTube channel where I did [interview with Udi Wertheimer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JIgdzVraFGk&t=1105s). I would like to film more interviews with people from the Ethereum Ecosystem to give more perspectives out to the public about Ethereum, find ways how to improve, simplify Ethereum, get to know more about people in Ethereum... (unfinished as it is in experimental state).

📝 I write notes and share interesting articles to my [Mind Garden](https://anettrolikova.tumblr.com/)


🚲 I share my physical activities on [Strava](https://www.strava.com/athletes/61054116)


📸 I do have [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/anett.rolikova/) 


📖 I do read books and share them on [Goodreads](https://www.goodreads.com/anett)
